# DatorTeknik-IS1200
Project and labs from KTH Computer Hardware Engineering class

In this course, you will learn how a computer system is constructed. After that the course finished, you will have a fundamental understanding of how a processor is constructed, how a computer executes machine code, and how memory hierarchies affect execution time. You will also learn the basic principles of parallel computation. At the laboratory exercises, you will write assembly and C code, see how programs are executed on an embedded hardware platform, and construct a functional single-cycle processor in a simulation environment. Finally, in groups of two students, you will construct a mini-project on a real embedded platform.

Our project was a Hand controlled "Fruit Ninja" using an accelerometer as input. Here's a video of it: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RLv3bLjpwZENJzAvI-vwcG4gG2Ryutg_/view?usp=sharing

We received the award as most impressive game from our teacher.
